The default is jasonbutz.info.I have the app set up to load the index file from the WebAppDemo/assets/ folder when it loads. This will show you navigation insidethe WebView and allow you to open Google, which loads with default browsers, or jasonbutz.info, which loads with the app.Resources---------Eclipse IDE: http://www.eclipse.orgAndroid Developer Portal: https://developer.android.com
